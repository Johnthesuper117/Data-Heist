## ⚔️ The Style System

The core of the game is the **Style Meter**. Killing enemies and performing risky maneuvers raises your Grade.

**Grades:** `D` ➔ `C` ➔ `B` ➔ `A` ➔ `S` ➔ `SS` ➔ `SSS`

### **Why Style Matters?**

As your Grade increases, your system overclocks:

1. **Dash Cooldown** decreases (Infinite dashing at SSS).

2. **Focus (Slow Mo)** drains slower.
3. **Projectiles** fly faster and **Explosions** get bigger.

### **How to Score**

* **SLICED:** Kill with the Data-Blade.
* **BOOM:** Kill with an Explosion.
* **MULTI-KILL:** Kill 2+ enemies at once.
* **PARRY:** Swing your blade to destroy enemy bullets or thrown guns.
* **DODGE (Graze):** Dash *through* enemy bullets. You won't take damage, but you will steal their energy.

2. **Pistol:** Reliable, moderate speed.
3. **Shotgun:** Wide spread. Devastating close up.
